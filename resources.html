<p>Throughout this workshop, each of the exercises and live-coding sessions will utilize data from the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, otherwise known as the MET, located in New York, United States. The museum offers data sets associated with the art and objects hosted in the museum via their public <a href="https://metmuseum.github.io">API</a>. Additional metadata associated with each image of the art piece or object was also generated using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision">Google Vision API</a>, and in particular the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/labels">Label detection</a>: Detect and extract information about entities in an image across a broad group of categories.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/object-localizer">Object annotation</a>: Detect and extract information about multiple objects in an image.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-properties">Image properties</a>: Detect color attributes of an image.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-crop-hints">Crop hints</a>: Obtain vertices of a cropped region for an image.</li>
