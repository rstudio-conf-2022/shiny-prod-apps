## The Beginning ... {background-color="black" background-image="assets/img/bg/beginning.png" background-size="cover"}

::: {.notes}
* You've seen Shiny could be a game-changer for a project
* Build an application quickly, purely with R code
* You send it to a key stakeholder, and they love it
:::

## Enter a new world

::: callout-warning
Add fun image
:::

::: {.notes}
* Everyone who sees it thinks the app is amazing
* Suddenly you are asked (or told) this needs to get into PRODUCTION
* ..... and now what?
:::

## Your Turn

What does *production-quality* mean to you?

```{r}
#| label: timer-prodquality
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 0)
```

## Many Users

:::

::: {.notes}
* Production can mean many different things to different people
* In my opinion, production means it is never just Shiny
* Not meant to be scary! 
* The tooling in the R ecosystem, especially around Shiny today, is able to create another pit of success

::: {.notes}
* Play this video as background in slide https://player.vimeo.com/video/652518341?background=1
* The Metropolitan Museum of Art (aka the MET) was founded in 1870

:::

## The MET Collection API

::: callout-warning
Add mini slide-show on side with a few example images
:::

::: {.notes}
* https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2018/met-collection-api
* Launched in 2018
* Over 400,000 art pieces without copyright 
* Rich amount of metadata associated with each piece of art
* Images themselves have potential to obtain additional data thanks to the Google Vision APIs
:::

## Previewing the workshop data

* Over 112,000 works across 17 collection departments
* A full history going all the way back to the Lower Paleolithic Period up to the last century


## The Art & Science of Building Shiny Apps

::: {.notes}
* In today's workshop, we're going to take solid first-draft of Shiny apps and up their quality to be production ready
* Like most of R itself, there are certainly more than one way to solve the issues we discuss in the next two days
* My goals are to share not just solutions, but give you a lense into the thought process and creativity that many times happens organically.
