# The Beginning ... {background-color="black" background-image="assets/img/bg/beginning.png" background-size="cover"}

::: {.notes}
* You've seen Shiny could be a game-changer for a project
* Build an application quickly, purely with R code
* You send it to a key stakeholder, and they love it
:::

# A New World {background-image="assets/img/bg/metroid_ship.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
* Everyone who sees it thinks the app is amazing
* Suddenly you are asked (or told) this needs to get into PRODUCTION
* ..... and now what?
:::

## Your Turn

## The Art & Science of Building Shiny Apps

::: {.notes}
* In today's workshop, we're going to take solid first-draft of Shiny apps and up their quality to be production ready
* Like most of R itself, there are certainly more than one way to solve the issues we discuss in the next two days
* My goals are to share not just solutions, but give you a lense into the thought process and creativity that many times happens organically.
