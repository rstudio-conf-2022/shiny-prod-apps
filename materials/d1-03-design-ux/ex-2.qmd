Let's continue on the journey to bring a little extra style and aesthetic flair to the MET Image Viewer. Using the [`{bslib}`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html) package, try customizing the application's fonts and various colors. If you want to achieve an overall look similar to the [MET brand](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2016/brand-identity), you could start with the [Arvo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo?category=Serif) or [Gelasio](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gelasio?category=Serif) Google Fonts. Most importantly, have fun!
