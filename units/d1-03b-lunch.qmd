It's time to replenish that Shiny learning energy with a delicious lunch! Before you head over to the {{< var lunch_location >}}, we would greatly appreciate if you take a minute to provide your feedback on how the workshop is going so far:

* Write one positive thing such as a new technique/capability you learned on a green sticky note
* Write one item that could use improvement, such as a topic going too fast or not clear enough on a pink sticky note. 

Your workshop team is also using this time to re-charge. If you have any questions, please wait to ask until we re-convene for the next unit.
